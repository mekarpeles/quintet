## Style

The story of Leina Grey is a monomyth / hero's journey, thematically most similar in world and intensity to the Lord of the Rings, but with a younger audience, accessible and fast-paced writing style, and emotional feel-good characteristics of harry potter.

## World

Our story takes place in an earth-like world called `Orbis`, a land not unlike ours, not yet spoiled by industrialization. Beautiful blue skies, lush woods, and cobblestone roads set the peaceful stage to contrast upcoming turmoil.

While not explicitly magical, has some worldly elements that are naturally fantastical or indistinguishable from magic in their own rights, similar to how science is both real and in many ways magical in our world. In this world, there is a lost art called "soul seeking" which is the ability (not unlike the idea of the "Force" from Star Wars). Similar to how Wim Hof might claim to manipulate the temperature or immune response of his body, soul seeking is the deep art and mastery of using one's life energy to catalyze interactions between cells, or invoking such reactions in another. While this phenomenon occurs naturally in the universe and nature, certain materials and areas seem more conducive to performing "soul seeking". One such material is the Oracle Stone, a type of black obsidian rock that behaves almost like a magnet for amplifying or focusing biological signals. On Orbis, there is a massive rock formation of Oracle Stone, simply called, "The Oracle", which extends deep into Orbis's mantle, its gravity concentrating an energy field towards and around it, as might a Tesla Coil.

## Outline

A political faction called the Red Shepherds (or the "Reds"), under the mythed merciless leadership of one simply called the "Protector", seeks to command the power of soul seeking to overcome their human limitations, to achieve mental and physical superiority, and to challenge death itself.

Leina Grey is a fourteen-year-old loner girl, the protaganist of our story, who was never raised to know a concept of "fun". She's smarter & more mature than the kids her age, most adults for that matter, and is very sensitive of the ways her experience lacks behind her theoretical knowledge.

Leina's mother, Nume, is paranoid, intense, and a bit crazy (maybe not without justification) and educates Leina harshly. Leina's job is essentially being a full-time college student while in "7th grade".

Leina is athletic but at the same time frail; she often falls sick. Nume is very private and refuses to take Leina to a doctor. She instead personally cares for her daughter using a book of medicine; a particularly old, annotated edition of the Soul Seeker's Manual which has been in her family for countless generations. For some reason Leina can often perceive when people were sick.

The Manual is one of many books in her family's expansive library. Its approach to medicine is slightly woo; heuristics & classical approaches. Somehow, perhaps having heard it so often, Leina feels a strange connection to the text. She can almost perceive when others are sick

For some reason Leina always found the approaches of the Soul Seeker's Manual intuitive, comfortable, and strangely familiar, if not a bit wrong or off in subtle ways she couldn't describe...

Leina can only take so much living w/ Nume & independently decides to move into the guest quarters of her widowed uncle, Nume's brother. He's a pushover; clearly scarred from growing up w/ Nume. Leina takes several books.

The Red Shepherds are trying to come to power. Their strategy is not only to achieve superior medical proficiency, but search for ways to boost their followers into superior soldiers. Their ultimate goal is immortality and the strength to conquer. They're after the Soul Seeker's Manuals, especially a fabled, annotated editions that may help them unlock the true power of the texts.

The one edition of the Soul Seeker's Manual with answers to these inquiries is the copy that Nume had, which now resides with Leina.

The Red Shepherds send an assassin to find the manuals. Aside from being circumstantially heartless, the assassin literally has a heart defect & is told his life depends on acquiring a specific annotated edition of this manual, as well as the help of the Red Shepherd's Soul Seekers, who can interpret & practice the book's medicine.

Leina's grandparents appear on soul seeking records under the control of the Red Shepherds. The assassin pillages her uncle's home and Leina is told by her spineless Uncle she must leave (for his own safety). The assassin finds Nume and dispenses of her in cold blood, Leina sees from outside the window. When he leaves, Leina goes inside to regard her mother and to gather supplies to flee but finds herself in the Assassin's trap.

Leina can inexplicably sense the Assassin is sick, perhaps her innate connection to Soul Seeking and years of exposure to the manual, and warns him that the book cannot help him, but if anyone can (she says with uncertainty), it's her. The assassin grabs her puts a knife to her throat and, in a moment of desperation, she undertakes a radical experiment; a spell of sorts to bind her life-force to his (similar to Leon the Professional). Ardivous can feel the change grip his heart as Leina explains: she is all now that prevents his heart from failing and he will meet this fate should she die or be turned against... But at what lost to Leina? She does not know.

Thus, in our emerging epic tale, Leina has found a way to secure her life & her mentor figure, whose fate (a la leon the professional) is now intertwined.

This story is about Leina's survival, and how it ultimately drives her to start a school of Soul Seeking (a la harry potter) and collect a group of trustworthy people to her side to stage a resistance against the Red Shepherds.

In the pursuit of survival, Leina must simultaneously yield to the assassin's agenda and leverage her soul seeking abilities and strategic prowess to amass enough power to gain the upper hand.
