Generally follows the mono-myth (Lord of the Rings-esque, no super powers though fantastical setting). Leina lives with her uncle who does little save from claim responsibility as her guardian. She is self-reliant and seeks mentorship from various places. She has no extraordinary capabilities other than an unhealthy "tiger-mother-esque" upbringing and overdeveloped sense of strategy / learned-ness and persuasion.

Setting is a fishing town outside of a larger city. Leina grows up in a remote foresty area, a few hour caravan ride away from the town.

The general tone / setting of the epic is similar to Game of Thrones in that there are warring cities trying to gain an upper hand. There's one band which operates in secrecy which referred to as the "Collectors". Everyone pays tribute to the Collectors. It's not known who is in charge (it's somewhat faceless, like anonymous). The "Academy" which Leina happens to form throughout the story comes to unintentionally undermine the Collector's authority and sinister plans.

Plot: Story starts with an assassin, Ardovus Retik who is hired to locate a book which has information to undermine the Collectors. Leina's parents are murdered, father, mother, and then her uncle. She confronts Ardovus with leverage that she knows where the book is. Ardovus assumes strange "gandalf / obiwan" elder figure when they realize they can use each other for great gains; a la "Leon the Professional".

Ardovus looks after Leina, using and nurturing her skills for personal gain. As the story progresses, Leina plays "moneyball" and comes across a handful of young prodigies whom she saves and inducts into a society of her own called the Academy.

Interesting avenues to explore / riff on:
- an academy setting, the politics of running a (harry-potter-like) academy.
- the logistics of the "one" book, what book is it?
- the conflict of the Collectors and the backstory


A coming of age story of a girl with no particular physical or
atheletic gifts who is able to use her ravenous knowledge, unstoppable
will-power, and keen sensitivity of the human condition to save and
unite talented youths, rejected by the world, to her side. What starts
as a band of friends grows into a political power capable of resisting
tyrrany of an unjust world.

It's Lord of the Rings / Harry Potter (Mono Myth) meets "Moneyball".
