Our story takes place in a land not unlike ours, not yet spoiled by industrialization. 
A peaceful stage set in contrast to upcoming turmoil: the rise of a political faction called the Red Shepherds.

- Earth-like: Beautiful blue skies, lush woods, and cobblestone roads set
- Pre-industrialization, no electricity, 
- Magic is a legend; a lost skill and , not ubiquitous
