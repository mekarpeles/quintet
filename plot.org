## The first shadow 

Before this scene, Leina and Nume were just preparing to sit for dinner when there was a knock at the door. "It's Finn", Leina said with confidence and boredom at the predictability of life in Blackmoor. But when Nume opened the door, Leina had to suppress her surprise at the attractive young courier's face, which was raw and purple with bruises that nearly prevented him entirely from seeing out of his left eye.



Finn liked delivering to the Greys and stole a look at their modest home library, admiring how it had become filled with the most eclectic collection of books over the years, in no small part because of him.



"Good evenin' missus Grey", Finn began, as if it were any ordinary day. He ruffled through some of the parcels in his sack and produced an obscure catalog. The latest "Wessland Trade", Finn said, opening it to reveal hand drawn trade routes with exotic items listed for sale in Wesslaki script. "No easy thing to come by", he said, mustering a half smile before connecting glances with Leina; his smile disappearing in a wave of self consciousness.



Nume took the catalog with care, her eyes scanning its contents. She looked up for a brief moment, assessing Finn's bruised face and then produced a handful of coins which she placed in his palm. "Thank you, Finn."



Finn accepted the payment with gratitude, his thumb discretely slid across the coins to count them. Despite his intentions, his brow furrowed slightly out of concern, an emote that was obvious to the two women.



"You couldn't be tempted by the latest Blackmoor Weekly?" Finn asked and then inwarly winced as he noticed a copy of the Weekly already on their table. "Truth told, today's work has left me short on coin for a meal..." he said with sincere embarrassment and shame.



Nume’s eyes, as sharp as any scholar’s, took in Finn’s quiet desperation. Her voice, when it came, was gentler than Leina expected, a warmth woven with a steel thread. "Finn, you look as though you've had a hard day. Join us for a meal, we were just about to sit."

Leina could read the strategy in her mother’s calculated grace. Nume was not without genuine warmth, but it was clear to Leina that Nume wished for pretense to learn everything she could about Finn's predicament without prying. Finn, possessing a quiet pride, nearly refused, but in his current position the offer of a warm meal was one he couldn't deny. He gave a clipped, almost painful nod of acceptance.

Finn, with as much restraint as he could manage, polished his bowl of rice and vegetable, his expression that of relief. Nume looked to Leina, as if activating her into the conversation. Leina sighed inaudibly to herself and regarded Finn's beaten face, "Did you try to sell someone fake spice?". You always had to worry about door to door salespeople selling fake spices in Blackmoor, but the accusation inflamed Finn, who had ever been an honest peddler. Leina knew it would.

"I've never sold fake anything!" Finn blurted, his eyes looking down to the table.

"Then what happened", Leina said.

Finn, proud Finn, said nothing. Until Nume joined the barrage.

"What happened Finn", Nume said gently, though it felt as much a demand as anything Finn had every heard. Finn had lost both his parents at a young age and he owed Nume a great deal for being one of his regular patrons. He knew he would have to answer.

"I was making a delivery up north to the Reds and I guess I wasn't fast enough."

"How late were you?" Leina asked curiously.

"I wasn't late" Finn said, "I made the trip within three days, just like I promised, but the Reds said their couriers deliver in two and they had no interest in paying full price to a lazy Freefolk"

"What did you say back that got you that shiner" Leina said, referring to Finn's eye.

"I didn't say anything. I turned to be on my way and he turned me around, scolded me for turning my back, and started teaching me a lesson...", Finn wiped his good eye and squinted as a salty tear rolled down his battered face. Finn cleared his throat. "I have to get some sleep so I can catch up tomorrow..." Finn said, both Nume and Leina nodding. "Thank you for the meal"
